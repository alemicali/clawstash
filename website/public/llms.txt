# Clawstash

> Clawstash is an open-source CLI tool that provides encrypted incremental backups for OpenClaw (a personal AI assistant). It backs up ~/.openclaw/ to any S3-compatible storage using AES-256 encryption and block-level deduplication.

Clawstash wraps the restic backup engine, auto-downloading the binary on first run. It includes an interactive setup wizard, background daemon (launchd/systemd), point-in-time restore, and selective restore by category (config, credentials, workspace, sessions, memory, skills, agents, settings).

Key facts:
- Requires Node >= 18
- Supports Cloudflare R2, AWS S3, Backblaze B2, MinIO
- Passphrase stored in OS keychain (macOS Keychain, Linux libsecret)
- Runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows via WSL2
- MIT licensed, created by Alessio Micali
